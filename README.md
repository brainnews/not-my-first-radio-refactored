# Not My First Radio - Refactored

A modern, algorithm-free internet radio player built with TypeScript and modular architecture. This is a complete refactor of the original monolithic codebase into a maintainable, scalable application.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Not My First Radio is a web-based radio streaming application that emphasizes discovery without algorithms. Users can search for stations worldwide, save favorites, and share collections with others - all without algorithmic recommendations or tracking.

### ✨ Key Features

- **Algorithm-free discovery** - Find stations naturally, not through AI recommendations
- **Global station database** - Access thousands of radio stations worldwide via Radio Browser API
- **No tracking** - Your data stays on your device
- **PWA support** - Install and use offline
- **Sharing system** - Share station collections via QR codes or links
- **Achievement system** - Track your listening milestones
- **Modern architecture** - TypeScript, ES modules, event-driven design

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This refactor transforms a 47,000-token monolithic JavaScript file into a clean, modular TypeScript application:

### 🔧 Key Improvements

#### From Monolithic to Modular
- **Before**: 3,804-line single file with mixed concerns
- **After**: 11 focused modules with single responsibilities

#### Type Safety
- **Before**: No type checking, runtime errors
- **After**: Full TypeScript coverage with compile-time error detection

#### Event-Driven Architecture
- **Before**: Direct function calls and tight coupling
- **After**: Centralized event system for loose coupling

#### Modern Tooling
- **Before**: No build process, manual file management
- **After**: Vite build system, hot reload, code splitting

#### Error Handling
- **Before**: Basic try-catch, silent failures
- **After**: Comprehensive error boundaries with user feedback

## 🎨 Event System

The application uses a centralized event system for module communication:

```typescript
// Emit events
eventManager.emit('station:play', station);
eventManager.emit('notification:show', notification);

// Listen to events  
eventManager.on('player:state-changed', (state) => {
  // Handle player state updates
});

// One-time listeners
eventManager.once('app:initialized', () => {
  // Handle app initialization
});
```

### Common Events

- `station:*` - Station-related events (add, remove, play, etc.)
- `player:*` - Audio player events (state changes, volume, etc.)
- `search:*` - Search-related events (started, completed, etc.)
- `settings:*` - Settings changes and updates
- `notification:*` - Notification display and management
- `modal:*` - Modal open/close events
- `user:*` - User data and achievement events

## 🔒 Data Management

### Storage Strategy
- **LocalStorage**: User preferences, stations, achievements
- **No server storage**: Everything stays on the device
- **Data portability**: Full import/export capabilities
- **Migration support**: Automatic upgrades from old formats

### Privacy Approach
- No tracking cookies or analytics
- No personal data collection
- Local-only data storage
- Explicit sharing through QR codes/links only

## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow functional programming patterns where possible
- Emit events instead of direct function calls
- Handle errors gracefully with user feedback
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming

### Module Creation
1. Define interfaces in `src/types/`
2. Create module class with clear responsibilities  
3. Use event system for inter-module communication
4. Include comprehensive error handling
5. Add cleanup method for resource management

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Integration tests for module interactions
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Mock external APIs in tests

## 📱 PWA Features

The application includes Progressive Web App capabilities:

- **Offline support** through service worker
- **Install prompts** for mobile and desktop
- **Background updates** with user notification
- **Responsive design** for all screen sizes
- **App-like experience** when installed

## 🐛 Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- Network failures don't break the app
- Invalid station URLs show helpful messages
- Storage failures fall back to memory-only mode
- Missing dependencies are handled gracefully

### User Feedback
- Clear error messages for user actions
- Loading states for async operations
- Success confirmations for important actions
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations

## 🔄 Migration from Original
